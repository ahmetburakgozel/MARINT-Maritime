**MARINT** is an Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) tool designed to process AIS (Automatic Identification System) data for **Maritime Situational Awareness**. It automatically filters millions of data points to detect suspicious vessel behaviors, generate target lists, and visualize threats on an interactive tactical map.

## 🎯 Core Capabilities

In the vastness of the oceans, manually tracking every vessel is impossible. MARINT acts as an automated "watchdog" to identify high-risk anomalies:

*   **🕵️‍♂️ Spoofing Detection:** Identifies vessels broadcasting a false navigation status.
    > *Logic:* If a ship claims to be `"Anchored"` or `"Moored"` but is moving at a speed **> 3.0 knots**, it is flagged as a spoofer attempting to mask its true activity.

*   **🌑 "Going Dark" Analysis:** Detects vessels that disable their AIS transponders for extended periods.
    > *Logic:* Flags vessels with signal gaps exceeding **4 hours**, a behavior often associated with illicit activities (smuggling, illegal fishing, etc.).

*   **🗺️ Interactive Tactical Map:** Generates a detailed HTML map visualizing normal traffic versus identified threats.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the analysis.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahmetburakgozel/MARINT-Maritime-Intelligence.git
cd MARINT-Maritime-Intelligence
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Analysis
Execute the main script to process the data and generate the intelligence products:
```bash
python run_analysis.py
```

---

## 📊 Intelligence Products

Upon successful execution, two key files are generated in the `outputs/` directory:

### 1. Tactical Map (`marint_intelligence_map.html`)
An interactive Folium map, viewable in any web browser.

| Marker | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| 🔵 **Blue Clusters** | Normal maritime traffic |
| 🔴 **Red Markers** | Vessels that "went dark" (>4h signal gap) |
| 🟠 **Orange Markers** | Spoofing targets (false status broadcast) |

### 2. Target List (`suspicious_targets_report.csv`)
A CSV report listing all suspicious vessels flagged during the analysis. It includes:
- `MMSI`
- `Name`
- `Callsign`
- `NavStatus` (Claimed)
- `SOG` (Actual Speed)
- `Coordinates`
- `Timestamp`

---

## 📈 Sample Findings (12-Hour Snapshot)

A test run on a sample AIS dataset yielded the following:

- **Total Vessels Tracked:** ~27,357
- **High-Risk Spoofing Alerts:** 124 vessels detected moving while claiming to be anchored.
- **Signal Gap Anomalies:** ~12,900 vessels with significant coverage gaps identified.
